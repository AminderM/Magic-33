**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack Fleet Supply Chain Marketplace application built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The codebase includes a main TMS application and a recently added, self-contained mobile-only driver web app module located at . This driver app features authentication, location tracking, an AI assistant (using the Emergent LLM Key), an Uber-like load management interface, mapping, and a driver analytics dashboard. The application has a multi-tenant architecture where data is isolated by  or .

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
- **P0: Build the Marketing Website.**
    - **Objective**: Create a new marketing website as a separate, standalone frontend application (e.g., in a new  directory) while keeping it in the same repository. This will ensure clean separation from the main TMS product.
    - **Action Plan**:
        1. Create a new React application structure.
        2. Build the static pages as requested: Homepage, Product, Use Cases, About, and Contact.
        3. Implement the design inspired by , focusing on a modern, dark/neutral theme, clean typography, and responsiveness.
        4. Use placeholder content and images for product screenshots and visuals.
        5. Ensure all Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons like Request a Demo are wired up, even if the backend logic is mocked for now.
- **P1: Apply TMS Theme to Remaining Driver App Screens.**
    - **Objective**: The agent previously applied the TMS theme (light/dark mode) to the main screens of the driver app but did not update all of them.
    - **Action Plan**: Update the UI of the , , and  to match the TMS theme for consistency.

**Future Tasks:**
- **Extract Driver Web App:** The driver app was built as a self-contained module within the main frontend project. The user's goal is to eventually host it on a separate domain (e.g., ). This will require extracting the code from  into a completely separate Emergent project.
- **AI Agent for Drivers:** The user mentioned that the current AI Assistant (which answers questions) should eventually be replaced by an AI Agent that can perform tasks for the driver.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Codebase Merge:** Successfully merged 18 branches from an external repository () into the current project, resolving unrelated histories and file conflicts.
- **Bug Fixes:**
    - **Login Failure:** Resolved post-merge login issues by recreating missing  files and correcting the password hashing logic in a user creation script.
    - **CORS Errors:** Fixed frontend-to-backend communication failures by correcting the CORS middleware configuration in .
    - **Routing Issues:** Solved multiple frontend routing problems, including Invalid Host header errors and proxy conflicts that caused 404 Not Found errors for valid app routes.
- **Mobile Driver Web App (MVP):**
    - **Core Functionality:** Built a comprehensive mobile-only driver app module at the  route.
    - **UI/UX Overhaul:** Rebuilt the driver app UI twice based on user feedback: first to match detailed wireframes, and second to align with the main TMS application's theme (including light/dark modes).
    - **Feature Implementation:**
        - Added an Uber-like interface for accepting/rejecting loads ().
        - Integrated a map screen with routing using Leaflet ().
        - Implemented an AI-powered assistant for drivers using the Emergent LLM Key ().
        - Created a My Analytics page for drivers to track earnings, miles, and hours ().
- **User Support:** Answered user questions regarding SaaS deployment models, multi-tenancy architecture, and domain/subdomain management.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frameworks:** React (with Create React App and Craco) for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend.
- **Database:** MongoDB.
- **Architecture:** Multi-tenant SaaS architecture with data isolation per customer/company.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for both TMS users and drivers.
- **Key Libraries:**
    -  &  for mapping.
    -  for seamless LLM integration (AI Assistant).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming (light/dark modes).

**key DB schema**
-   **users:** 
-   **loads:** 
-   **driver_locations:** 

**changes in tech stack**
-  and  were added for the mapping feature in the driver app.

**All files of reference**
- **Driver App Backend:**
    - : Endpoints for driver login, loads, status, location pings, and analytics.
    - : Endpoint for the driver's AI assistant chat.
- **Driver App Frontend:**
    - : Directory containing all components for the driver app, structured as a self-contained module. Key files include  (router),  (mobile/location gates),  (Uber-like UI), and .
- **Environment & Config:**
    - : Updated to manage the backend URL and disable host checks. The  was removed from .
    - : Contains global styles, Tailwind directives, and Leaflet CSS import.
    - : Main FastAPI app file where CORS and routers are configured.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The new marketing website should be created as a separate frontend project (e.g., ) rather than being added to the existing  codebase. This will keep the product application and the marketing site decoupled, which is better for maintenance, deployment, and performance.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The immediate priority is to start building the new marketing website as described in the user's latest prompt. The recommended approach is to create a new, separate React project for this website to keep it isolated from the main TMS application.
- The agent successfully resolved a confusing preview URL issue. The correct URL for testing is based on the job name (e.g., ), not a UUID-based one. Ensure you use the correct URL for testing.
- The driver app includes a  query parameter to bypass the mobile-only restriction for desktop testing. This will be useful for any further work on that module.
